Drawing Shapes
==============

Now that you can drive distances, and turn, put those skills together and draw a shape!

.. tip:: 

    To see the path your XRP has driven, you will need to place a dry-erase marker between the
    robot's wheels and trace your pattern on a whiteboard.


Select a random card, and program the shape described on it.
